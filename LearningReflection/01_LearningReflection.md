## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- I have previously tested a mobile app in a previous course and this was similar to that. 
    

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I first set the title for the test case then I started the process of the test step by step and then when the test case was completed
I also included the expected results
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I have used bugzilla for testing but that was more for automation testing


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I use visual code studio


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-I really didn't have any trouble doing the project. If something it took a bit time reading and figuring things out but after that it was smooth sailing.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-I have used GitHub before and used them on previous courses.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would probably use bugzilla



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Preferably a bachelor's degree and 3â€“5 years of experience, or an equivalent combination of education and experience
- Strong understanding of the importance of testing in the software development process
- Proficiency in automated test scripting




## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I have to have at least a few years of experience.
- I need to improve my skills related to software testing




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I liked this task a lot. Maybe there could be more of this hands on testing? 
The videos and material are fine but I like to do the actual thing because I feel like I learn the best like that.
Overall this was a good course, I did a more hands on course previously but this was a lot more theoretical and it deepend my knowledge on software testing as a whole.
